# Quickstart: Synthesize speech in C++ for Linux

This sample demonstrates how to synthesize speech with C++ using the Speech SDK for Linux.
See the [accompanying article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstarts/text-to-speech-audio-file?tabs=ubuntu%2Cwindowsinstall&pivots=programming-language-cpp) on the SDK documentation page for step-by-step instructions.

> **Note:**
> We currently only support [specific Linux distributions and target architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk?tabs=linux).

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A Linux PC with a working speaker or headset.
* See the [Linux platform requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?tabs=linux&pivots=programming-language-cpp#platform-requirements) for installing the required dependencies.

## Build the sample

* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)
* Download and extract the Speech SDK
  * **By downloading the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK, you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license).**
  * Run the following commands after replacing the string `/your/path` with a directory (absolute path) of your choice:

    ```sh
    export SPEECHSDK_ROOT="/your/path"
    mkdir -p "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
    wget -O SpeechSDK-Linux.tar.gz https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary
    tar --strip 1 -xzf SpeechSDK-Linux.tar.gz -C "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
    ```
* Navigate to the directory of this sample
* Edit the file `Makefile`:
  * In the line `SPEECHSDK_ROOT:=/change/to/point/to/extracted/SpeechSDK` change the right-hand side to point to the location of your extract Speech SDK for Linux.
  * If you are running on Linux x86 (32-bit), change the line `TARGET_PLATFORM:=x64` to `TARGET_PLATFORM:=x86`.
  * If you are running on Linux ARM64 (64-bit), change the line `TARGET_PLATFORM:=x64` to `TARGET_PLATFORM:=arm64`.
* Edit the `helloworld.cpp` source:
  * Replace the string `YourSubscriptionKey` with your own subscription key.
  * Replace the endpoint URL `https://YourServiceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com` with the endpoint for your Speech resource. You can find this endpoint in the Azure Portal under your Speech resource's "Keys and Endpoint" section.
    For example, the endpoint might look like `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com` if your resource is in the West US region. Make sure the endpoint in your code matches the one in your Azure resource, otherwise you'll get a 401 unauthorized access error.
* Run the command `make` to build the sample, the resulting executable will be called `helloworld`.

## Run the sample

To run the sample, you'll need to configure the loader's library path to point to the Speech SDK library.

* On an x64 machine, run:

  ```sh
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x64"
  ```

* On an x86 machine, run:

  ```sh
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/x86"
  ```

* On an ARM64 machine, run:

  ```sh
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SPEECHSDK_ROOT/lib/arm64"
  ```

Run the application:

```sh
./helloworld
```
